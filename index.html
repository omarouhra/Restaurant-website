                <p>If you are considering purchasing a new grill, or barbecue, you will be faced with a multitude of
                    options to choose between. However, there is one choice which you will need to make fairly quickly
                    in your quest for the perfect grill for you. That decision is whether to buy a charcoal or gas
                    grill.<br><br>
                    Wow I have a hankering for some really good grill roasted chicken, the melt in your mouth variety
                    with some fresh homemade salsa slathered right on top.
